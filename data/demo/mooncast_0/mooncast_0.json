        },

            "speaker": "1",
            "text": "Yeah, GPT 4 O. The O stands for omni, right? Which, like, hints at its ability to handle, well, everything. Text, audio, images, even video. It's a big deal because it's all in one model."
        },
        {
            "speaker": "0",
            "text": "Okay, so, omni meaning everything. So it's not just typing, like we're used to with, you know, chat bots. It can actually hear and see, and, uh, talk back, all in real time, right?"
        },
        {
            "speaker": "1",
            "text": "Right. Think about the old way, like with voice assistants. They'd listen, then convert that to text, then the AI would think, then it would generate text, and finally, that text would be read out loud. That's a lot of steps, isn't it?"
        },
        {
            "speaker": "0",
            "text": "Yeah, that sounds, uh, clunky. So each of those steps, is that a separate AI, like, doing its own little thing?"

            "speaker": "1",
            "text": "Exactly. They were like separate AI models chained together. One for ASR, automatic speech recognition, turning your voice into text, then another for processing the text, and yet another for text to speech, turning the response back into audio. Each step adds delay, you know, latency."

            "speaker": "0",
            "text": "Latency, okay. So that's the, uh, technical term for the delay, the lag, right? That makes sense. It's like playing a video game online with a bad connection, it's, it's just frustrating."

            "speaker": "1",
            "text": "Yeah, a perfect analogy. And it's not just about speed. Those separate steps, they also lose information. Think about tone of voice, sarcasm, background noises, all that gets lost when you just convert to plain text."

            "speaker": "1",

            "speaker": "1",
            "text": "Right. It's one single neural network, trained end-to-end. That's the key phrase, end-to-end. It means the AI learns to process everything, all the different types of information, all at the same time."

            "speaker": "0",

            "speaker": "1",
            "text": "Yeah, you can think of it that way. A single brain that can see, hear, read, and speak. And because it's all integrated, it can respond much faster. They're saying it can respond in as little as two hundred and thirty-two milliseconds, with an average of three hundred and twenty milliseconds."

            "speaker": "1",
